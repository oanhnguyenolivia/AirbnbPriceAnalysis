<h1>Airbnb Price Analysis Dashboard</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project centered around exploring the factors influencing Airbnb prices for potential hosts. Leveraging data from various tables, I conducted comprehensive analyses using Tableau to uncover insights into the impact of key factors such as bedrooms, location, and date on the average pricing. This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for aspiring Airbnb hosts, providing clear visualizations to aid in strategic decision-making when determining optimal pricing strategies based on property characteristics and market trends.
